[#Collection and Product Registration,reftext='7']
== Collection and Product Registration

=== Overview

We propose to include a high level description of a HTTP REST API to
programmatic register collections and products in ODA Systems.

The API needs to specify the request and response structure as well as the
payloads. Both, particularly the payload, depend heavily on the functionality
available in concrete implementations. Thus we propose to evaluate the
suitability to specify collection and product registration including
suitability to specify a minimal set of services an ODA System has to support.

The GeoServer REST API 20 serves as basis for our proposal.
