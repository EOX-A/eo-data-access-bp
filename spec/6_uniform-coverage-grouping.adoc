[#Uniform Coverage Grouping,reftext='9']
== Uniform Coverage Grouping

=== Overview

We propose to carefully review to which extent the forthcoming CIS 1.1 is
prepared for this.

The new partitioning functionality of CIS 1.1 requires all partitions to share
the same range type partitions which is exactly what is ask for in this item.
On the other side it requires partitions to not overlap which would require to
use real 3D coverages in order to group 2D EO coverages.

This needs to be further reviewed in order to harmonize with the concepts of
EO-WCS. In any case this might be best suited to be integrated and documented
in the solution to the "General Coverage Grouping" item detailed in section
3.3.1 below.
