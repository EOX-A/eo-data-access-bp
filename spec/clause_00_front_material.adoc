[big]*iii.   Preface*

This OGC Best Practice document details proposed configuration and
instantiation conventions and recommendations on how to utilize OGC services
for access to Earth Observation (EO) data. These proposed conventions and
recommendations have been developed in the http://www.esa.int/ESA[European
Space Agency (ESA)] funded project
https://wiki.services.eoportal.org/tiki-index.php?page=EVO-ODAS[Evolution of
EO Online Data Access Services (EVO-ODAS)].

It is defined how to utilize OGC's http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs[
Web Coverage Service (WCS)] with EO products including generic conventions and
recommendations for data and metadata mapping and conversions which are to be
used in concrete tailorings for specific missions. It further considers how to
link to other services like CSW, OpenSearch, WMS, WMTS, DS-EO, and WPS.

Suggested additions, changes, and comments on this draft document are welcome
and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message to the
document editor or contributors named above, by creating an issue or a pull
request at the https://github.com/EOX-A/eo-data-access-bp[GitHub repository],
or by making suggested changes in an edited copy of this document.
