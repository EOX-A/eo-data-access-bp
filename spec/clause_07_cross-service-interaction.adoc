== Cross Service Interaction

=== Overview

In a number of scenarios and use cases it is necessary to be able to link from
one service to another, holding e.g. different views on the same data. For
example a user might first be presented with an RGB view on some data via WMS
before downloading the actual data, that is, full bands via WCS. The question
is, how is a client supposed to construct WCS requests for the same product
just seen via WMS? Currently there is no standard way defined how to provide
such links.

We propose to address the cross service interaction item by giving
recommendations on how to structure the data offered in the various services as
well as how to explicitly link between them. These explicit link
recommendations include these services: OpenSearch, WMS, WMTS, WCS, and DS-EO.

An example for a data structuring recommendation is that for a collection there
should be an EO-WMS layer and an EO-WCS DatasetSeries provided both reusing the
ID of the collection. Thus clients know that a product viewed via a GetMap
request with TIME parameter can be downloaded via a GetEOCoverageSet request
using the same TIME parameter value.

First explicit linking recommendations are given in the "EVO-ODAS
Recommendation on building a discovery interface using OpenSearch Technical
Note (EVOODAS-TN-GEO-4112 version 1.3.0 from 2017-10-24)" by GeoSolutions. The
recommendation there is to use OWC ATOM `offering` elements linking to the EO
Product in the respective service. Note that it also includes recommendations
on how to structure these links in order to link to a single product. In short
the recommendation is to link to a tailored Capabilities document like e.g.,
`http://u.rl?service=WMS&acceptVersions=1.3.0&request=GetCapabilities&layers=S2`.
This covers all links from OpenSearch to any other service.

In the same way recommendations will be given from (EO-)WMS, WMTS, (EO-)WCS,
and DS-EO to the respective four other services using for example
`wms:DataURL`, in the layer specification of the WMS Capabilities linking to
the corresponding EO-WCS DatasetSeries.
