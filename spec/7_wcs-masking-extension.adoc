[#WCS Masking Extension,reftext='8']
== WCS Masking Extension

=== Overview

We propose to extend the GetCoverage request with parameters to request a
masking via a mask coverage or polygons e.g. given as GeoJSON or shapefile. The
coverage of polygons can be given by reference or, if small enough, included
directly in the request in case of polygons as WKT.

The response shall use a defined NoData value for areas outside of the mask.

In the frame of EVO-ODAS this will be described in the EO Data Access Best
Practice. Later on this might be promoted to an actual WCS extension.
